# Colosseum & Ludus

Static mobile gladiator game served by GitHub Pages. Supabase owns accounts, equipment and multiplayer match state.

## Combat V23

Melee attacks use wind-up, blade contact and recovery. Shield contact interrupts a cut into a continuous recoil. Pressing the existing block control just before contact staggers the attacker and enables one short counter with the existing attack control. Holding block protects normally. The current embedded CC0 Quaternius clips are retained.

Apply `ludus-v23.sql` in the project's Supabase SQL Editor after V22. The migration is repeatable and uses one transaction. It replaces only multiplayer combat RPCs and retains V22 ownership and clan reservation checks. The final query returns `Dövüş V23 hazır`. The updated multiplayer client accepts V22 responses until the migration is applied; authoritative delayed contact and timed counters require V23.

Online strikes resolve once at their scheduled contact time. The server validates facing, distance, equipped shields and new guard presses. Attack command IDs prevent a lost response from applying the same attack again. No reward or item settlement was added to the multiplayer beta.

## Validation

Run `node --test tests/combat-feel-v23.test.cjs` with Node 18 or later. The tests exercise shield recoil, timed counters, held and rapidly toggled defense, target and expiry checks, projectile defense, and compilation of embedded scripts.

Local PostgreSQL checks also cover repeatable migration, delayed damage, attack retry deduplication, late defense and authorization. Browser checks use local assets and an isolated battle fixture. Actual iPhone frame rate and a live two-device match still need device validation.
